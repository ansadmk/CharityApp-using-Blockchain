Charity-app is a mobile application that allows users to engage with charitable organizations and make donations. The app's goal is to bridge the gap between donors and charities by providing an easy-to-use platform for users to discover and support causes that are important to them. Users can use the app to explore different charitable groups, learn about their missions and effect, and make secure donations. CharityApp's mission is to create a streamlined and efficient way for people to contribute to causes that are important to them, eventually helping to make a positive impact on the world. Charity-app is a mobile application that uses block-chain technology to enable donations to charitable organizations. The app enables users to engage with various charities and safely transfer donations while maintaining transparency and accountability. Charity-app provides a tamper-proof record of all donations by leveraging the power of block-chain technology, guaranteeing that every penny achieves its intended destination. This project seeks to make charitable giving more accessible, efficient, and secure, allowing users to have a positive influence on their communities and the world
